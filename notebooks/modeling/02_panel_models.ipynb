       "### Fixed Effects Results\n",
       "\n",
       "Our fixed effects model controls for both country-specific and time-specific unobserved factors that could affect poverty levels. The coefficient on financial inclusion represents the average effect of increasing financial inclusion on poverty reduction within a country over time.\n",
       "\n",
       "A negative coefficient suggests that increases in financial inclusion are associated with reductions in poverty, supporting the hypothesis that financial inclusion serves as a poverty alleviation mechanism. The magnitude of this coefficient gives us an elasticity: a 1% increase in financial inclusion is associated with a Î²% decrease in the poverty headcount ratio.\n",
       "\n",
       "### IV Results and Endogeneity\n",
       "\n",
       "The instrumental variable approach addresses potential reverse causality - the concern that changes in poverty might drive changes in financial inclusion rather than the other way around. By using lagged financial inclusion as instruments, we isolate the component of financial inclusion that is predetermined relative to current poverty levels.\n",
       "\n",
       "If the IV coefficient differs substantially from the FE coefficient, this suggests that endogeneity was indeed a concern. The first-stage F-statistic above 10 indicates our instruments are reasonably strong.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Interaction Effects\n",
       "\n",
       "The interaction models reveal important heterogeneity in how financial inclusion affects poverty:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. **Inequality (lngini)**: The interaction term tells us whether financial inclusion is more or less effective at reducing poverty in high-inequality vs. low-inequality contexts. A positive interaction coefficient would suggest that financial inclusion is less effective at reducing poverty in high-inequality environments, possibly because the benefits of financial services don't reach the poorest segments of the population.\n",
       "\n",
       "2. **Gender Inequality (gii)**: This interaction examines whether gender disparities affect the poverty-reduction potential of financial inclusion. A positive interaction coefficient indicates that financial inclusion is less effective in countries with higher gender inequality, highlighting the importance of gender-inclusive financial policies.\n",
       "\n",
       "3. **Rule of Law (ruleoflaw)**: This interaction examines how institutional quality affects the relationship. A negative interaction coefficient suggests that financial inclusion is more effective at reducing poverty in countries with stronger legal institutions, emphasizing the complementarity between financial development and institutional quality.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Threshold Effects\n",
       "\n",
       "The threshold regression identifies a critical level of inequality beyond which the relationship between financial inclusion and poverty reduction changes significantly. This nonlinearity has important policy implications:\n",
       "\n",
       "- Below the threshold, financial inclusion has a certain impact on poverty (given by the below-threshold coefficient)\n",
       "- Above the threshold, this impact changes (given by the above-threshold coefficient)\n",
       "\n",
       "If the effect is stronger below the threshold, this suggests that countries should prioritize reducing inequality to a level below this threshold to maximize the poverty-reduction benefits of financial inclusion policies.\n",
       "\n",
       "### Policy Implications\n",
       "\n",
       "Based on these results, policymakers should:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Continue to promote financial inclusion as a means of poverty reduction\n",
       "2. Pay special attention to inequality levels, gender disparities, and institutional quality when designing financial inclusion policies\n",
       "3. Consider threshold effects when sequencing reforms - in high-inequality contexts, complementary policies addressing inequality may need to accompany financial inclusion initiatives\n",
       "4. Target financial services specifically to disadvantaged groups in contexts where the average effect of financial inclusion on poverty reduction is weaker\n",
       "\n",
       "### Limitations\n",
       "\n",
       "Our analysis faces several limitations:\n",
       "\n",
       "1. Data quality varies across countries and time periods\n",
       "2. The $2.15 poverty line was dropped due to missing data (as shown in missing_poverty.png)\n",
       "3. While our IV approach addresses some endogeneity concerns, we cannot rule out all sources of bias\n",
       "4. The models assume that the relationship is stable over the sample period, which may not hold if structural changes occurred\n",
       "\n",
       "Future research should address these limitations and explore additional dimensions of heterogeneity in the financial inclusion-poverty relationship."
